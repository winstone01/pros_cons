# pros_cons
A simple, responsive decision-making app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start by entering your decision topic (e.g., “Should I learn Next.js?”), then add points to either side. The app automatically tracks totals and updates a verdict in real time — making it easy to sanity-check your thinking without overcomplicating it.
